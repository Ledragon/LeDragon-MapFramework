# Description
A framework to generate maps in JavaScript. This framework is based on d3 and Natural Earth data files.

The idea is to be able to generate world maps or countries map, with different level of details, according to what is selected, zoom on region, display map of specified country, etc.

The framework is at an early stage of development, I hope I get time to put more effort in it to get it more complete.
